- T(x): The student has taken course x.
- Prereq(x, y): Course y is a prerequisite for course x.
- CanTake(x): The student can take course x.
- AllPrereqsTaken(x): All prerequisites for course x have been taken.

5b.
Prerequisites for courses:
	•	Prereq(CPSC375, CPSC131) (CPSC131 is a prerequisite for CPSC375)
	•	Prereq(CPSC375, MATH338) (MATH338 is a prerequisite for CPSC375)
	•	Prereq(CPSC481, CPSC335) (CPSC335 is a prerequisite for CPSC481)
	•	Prereq(CPSC481, MATH338) (MATH338 is a prerequisite for CPSC481)
	•	Prereq(CPSC483, CPSC375) (CPSC375 is a prerequisite for CPSC483)

A course can only be taken if all prerequisites have been taken:
	•	CanTake(x) ← AllPrereqsTaken(x)

If a course has been taken, all of its prerequisites have also been taken:
	•	T(x) → AllPrereqsTaken(x)

A course cannot be taken again:
	•	¬CanTake(x) ← T(x)

5c.
With CPSC481 taken:

i. CanTake(CPSC375)? → Valid
ii. CanTake(CPSC481)? → Invalid
iii. CanTake(CPSC483)? → Valid
iv. T(CPSC375)? → Unknown (Invalid)

5d.
With CPSC131 and CPSC481 taken:

i. CanTake(CPSC375)? → Valid
ii. CanTake(CPSC481)? → Invalid
iii. CanTake(CPSC483)? → Valid
iv. T(CPSC375)? → Unknown (Invalid)

6b.
course(cpsc499).
prereq(cpsc499, cpsc375).
prereq(cpsc499, cpsc481).
The current rules will automatically adjust to the new courses because they rely on the prereq/2 and course/1 predicates.
No additional changes are needed in the rules. However, user-specific facts about which courses have been taken should be updated to reflect the student’s progress.
